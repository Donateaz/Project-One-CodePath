# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [Tired, worked, but did not show graphics] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [Tired, worked, but did not show graphics] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [Tired, worked, but did not show graphics] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Clicking Search withdraws Keyboard but keeps filtered movies whereas clicking Cancel withdraws keyboard and shows all movies
- [Tired, worked, but did not show graphics] Once network error resolves, the network error view can withdrawn by clicking on it (part of optional feature) and also by pull-down refresh (additional feature). 

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Setting CollectionViewLayout values.
2. swift optionals, wrapping. unwrapping etc

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. Setting CollectionViewLayout values. I had to do a lot of hit & trial to get the right spacing.
